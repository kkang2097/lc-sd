## Hackathon Info
Problem Statement (2): Native Multimodality

I went out and built the multiple modalities in the UI. Even without training Llama4 on my own DAG format, it processed my query!

Additionally, I think `Leetcode for System Design` must fundamentally be multi-modal, both in the user inputs and knowledge context in the backend.
